      <h3>CarrierWave</h3>
      <h4>What CarrierWave Says:</h4>

      <p>This gem provides a simple and extremely flexible way to upload files from Ruby applications.
        It works well with Rack based web applications, such as Ruby on Rails.</p>

      <h4>What Jason Thinks:</h4>

      <p>It makes it so you can pretend an uploaded file is just another ActiveRecord field like <code>string, boolean,
        integer</code> whatever.</p>

      <h3>Cloudinary</h3>
      <h4>What Cloudinary Says:</h4>

      <p>Cloudinary is the image back-end for web and mobile developers.
        An end-to-end solution for all your image-related needs.</p>

      <h4>What Jason Thinks:</h4>

      <p>An image hosting site (CDN) for dummies.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Create a photo model: <code>rails g model photo name:string image:string</code></li>
        <li>Database stuff: <code>rake db:create</code> <code>rake db:migrate</code></li>
        <li>routes.rb: <code>resources :photos</code> <code>root "photos#index"</code></li>
        <li>Controller stuff: <code>rails g controller photos</code></li>
        <li>
          <small>I typed real stupid or .coffee files scare me and I want that stuff to go away

      <h3>What does this have to do with Cloud Hosting?</h3>
      <p>So the only thing we have done so far that has anything to do with Hosting images on Cloudinary is our model
        creation. <code>image:string</code>. This is a Carrierwave thing. This is what Carrierwave does. It stores a
      string that looks suspiciously like a uri and magically turns it into a bunch of objects (or object looking things)
        when you access it in your code. You will see if we make it that far.</p>
